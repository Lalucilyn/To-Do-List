# To-Do-List
A simple to-do-list made for fun and to practice ReactJs
A couple of notes about this project:
- This is an ongoing personal project made for practice.
- It's being tested on Chrome and Firefox.

What it does right now:
- It's a functioning dynamic to do list. It allows the user to add new tasks and delete them individually.

What I want it to do in the future
- Save the data when the page is closed or refreshed.
- Maybe add a feature to delete all notes at the same time.
